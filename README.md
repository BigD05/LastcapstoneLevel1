# LastcapstoneLevel1
this project is the same as ThirdCapstoneproject so have a look at that if you wan't a better understanding on what happening but basically this project makes use of functions in python 
that refactor the code making it alot better and scalable so in this task the user types in the password if it is wrong then will be prompted to enter it again and if the user enters the correct name and password 
than based on the user type e.g admin they will be displayed a different menue and in this case unlike the previouse project the admin is alot more powerful wiht alot of other options to run by 
where as the normal user dosen't have as many options
